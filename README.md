# My LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems I have solved on the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) platform.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
* To share my solutions with the community.
* To gain practice by doing code exercises in different programming languages.
* To track my progress over time.

## Languages Used

To ensure code diversity, three different languages are used in the solutions:
* **Java**
* **C#**
* **Python**

Not every problem may be solved in all three languages, but the use of all three will be featured throughout the repository.

## Folder Structure

Solutions are organized into folders based on LeetCode problem difficulty and categories:

* **/Easy**: Solutions to easy-level problems.
* **/Medium**: Solutions to medium-level problems.
* **/Hard**: Solutions to hard-level problems.
* **/DailyQuestions**: Daily questions solved for the LeetCode "streak".
